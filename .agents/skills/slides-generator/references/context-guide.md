# Context Collection Guide

> Progressive disclosure approach for gathering presentation requirements

## Purpose

Gather requirements efficiently using structured question flow. Apply progressive disclosure: show 3-5 questions at a time, reveal more based on answers.

## Question Flow Framework

### Phase 1: Quick Start (Always Ask)

**Goal**: Get started with minimal friction

```
Q1: "What's the presentation about?"
    [Open text - let user explain in their own words]

Q2: "Brief description or any content to include?"
    [Optional - paste existing content, notes, or outline]
```

### Phase 2: Audience & Purpose (Always Ask)

**Goal**: Understand who and why

```
Q3: "Who will view this?"
    Options:
    - Executives / Decision makers
    - Technical team / Developers
    - General audience / Mixed
    - Customers / External stakeholders

Q4: "What's the goal?"
    Options:
    - Inform - Share knowledge or updates
    - Persuade - Convince or propose
    - Demo - Show product or process
    - Report - Present data or results
```

### Phase 3: Style Discovery (Always Ask)

**Goal**: Calibrate visual direction with user choice using design intelligence

**Step 1 - Get keywords**:
```
Q5: "Describe the vibe in a few words"
    Examples: "tech, modern, dark" or "professional, clean, corporate"
```

**Step 2 - Use ui-ux-pro-max for design recommendations**:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<topic> <keywords> presentation" --design-system -p "<Presentation Name>"
```

This provides:
- Style recommendations with reasoning
- Color palette suggestions
- Typography pairings (heading + body fonts)
- Animation and effect guidelines
- Anti-patterns to avoid

**Step 3 - Combine with palettes.md to present 5 options**:

Merge ui-ux-pro-max recommendations with palettes.md to offer 5 curated choices:
Example prompt to user:
```
"Based on your description and design analysis, here are 5 style options:

1. **[Palette Name]** ([glass/flat]) - Recommended
   [Visual description]
   Typography: [Heading Font] + [Body Font]
   Best for: [Scenario]

2. **[Palette Name]** ([style])
   [Description]
   Typography: [Fonts]
   Best for: [Scenario]

3. **[Palette Name]** ([style])
   [Description]
   Typography: [Fonts]
   Best for: [Scenario]

4. **[Palette Name]** ([style])
   [Description]
   Typography: [Fonts]
   Best for: [Scenario]

5. **[Palette Name]** ([style])
   [Description]
   Typography: [Fonts]
   Best for: [Scenario]

Which style? (1-5)"
```

**Keyword to palette mapping** (for manual matching):

| User Keywords | Search Tags | Typical Style |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| tech, modern, dark | dark, tech, professional | glass |
| professional, corporate | professional, business, light | flat |
| creative, bold, vibrant | neon, cyberpunk, colorful | glass |
| natural, organic, calm | nature, green, soft | flat |
| minimal, clean, simple | minimal, black-white, light | flat |
| luxury, premium | gold, metallic, luxury | glass |

**User selects a number (1-5)** → Capture in context.md with full details

### Phase 4: Content Depth (Conditional)

**Trigger**: Based on topic complexity

```
Q6: "What are 3-5 key points to cover?"
    [Helps structure the presentation]

Q7: "Any specific data or statistics to include?"
    - Yes, I have data → [Ask for details]
    - Research needed → [Trigger research workflow]
    - No data needed → [Skip]
```

### Phase 5: Research Checkpoint (Conditional)

**Trigger**: When data/research would improve the presentation

```
"This topic would benefit from research. Would you like me to:

[ ] Research current data/statistics
[ ] Find competitive comparisons
[ ] Gather industry trends
[ ] Skip research - I'll provide the content"
```

See [research-templates.md](research-templates.md) for research patterns.

### Phase 6: Advanced Options (Optional)

**Trigger**: Only if user wants more control

```
Q8: "Any brand guidelines or colors to follow?"
    [Optional - for corporate presentations]

Q9: "Reference presentations you like?"
    [Optional - URLs for style calibration]

Q10: "Special requirements?"
    [Optional - constraints, export format, etc.]
```

## Drill-Down Patterns

When users give abstract terms, ask for concrete details:

| User Says | Follow-Up |
|-----------|-----------|
| "Professional" | "Clean and minimal, or rich and detailed?" |
| "Modern" | "Can you point to an example?" |
| "High quality" | "What specific qualities signal that to you?" |
| "Engaging" | "Animations and interactivity, or compelling content?" |
| "Simple" | "Minimal content per slide, or minimal design elements?" |

## Question Best Practices

### Do
- Ask open-ended questions first, then narrow down
- Show visual examples when asking about style
- Ask about past experiences ("What presentations have you liked?")
- Let users skip optional questions
- Confirm understanding before proceeding

### Don't
- Ask more than 5 questions at once
- Use yes/no questions for discovery
- Ask hypothetical questions ("What might resonate?")
- Assume technical knowledge about design
- Skip the style discovery phase

## Context Document Template

After gathering requirements, create `context.md`:

```markdown
# Presentation Context

## Purpose
- **Goal**: [inform/persuade/demo/report from Q4]
- **Expected outcome**: [what audience should do/know after]

## Audience

- **Expertise level**: [beginner/intermediate/expert]
- **Key interests**: [what they care about]

## Key Points
[From Q6 - 3-5 main points]

### [Point 1]

- [Stat]: [Source]

## Style (User Selected)

# Mode: team-respawn (200k-context default)

You (the leader) spawn a **fresh teammate per workflow step** and shut it down when the step is complete. This is the legacy behavior — appropriate when the model has only 200k context and reusing an agent across stories would risk context overflow.

**Agent teams vs normal sub-agents:** Agent teams let teammates message each other directly and coordinate on shared tasks. Prefer agent teams when available. The spawning format below creates team members, not standalone sub-agents. If agent teams are not available in the current environment, fall back to normal sub-agents (same spawn format but without `team_name` and without `run_in_background: true`).

## Why per-step respawn (not per-story persistence) on 200k

A 200k window fills quickly: project context + PRD + architecture + story file + code being written = often >150k tokens. Carrying that across stories means each new story starts with a near-full window and crowds out the actual work. Respawning gets you a clean slate per step at the cost of paying onboarding tokens each time. On 1M models this trade flips — see `team-persistent.md`.

## Sub-agents (created per step, then shut down)

| Step | Teammate name | Role-skill to invoke (first action) | Workflow skill (per request) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Story create | `story-creator` | `bmad-agent-pm` | `bmad-create-story` |
| Story develop | `story-developer` | `bmad-agent-dev` | `bmad-dev-story` |
| Functional validate | `func-validator` | `{TESTER_PERSONA}` (resolved at startup — see SKILL.md → "Tester role-skill availability check") | `{TESTER_SKILL}` (resolved at startup) + bmad-auto's `references/functional-validation.md` for runtime smoke |
| Quick develop | `quick-developer` | `bmad-agent-dev` | `bmad-quick-dev` |
| Escalation only | `tech-researcher` | `bmad-agent-analyst` | `bmad-technical-research` |

**Story validation and code review are NOT in this list.** The leader does both in this conversation, in every mode. Do not spawn `story-validator` or `code-reviewer` sub-agents.

## Team naming

Same as `team-persistent.md`: generate `{TEAM_NAME}` once at session start (hold in conversation memory, not a file) and reuse for every spawn.

## Effort tuning

Use the 200k-context column from SKILL.md:

| Teammate | Model | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| `story-creator` | opus | `xhigh` |
| `story-developer` / `quick-developer` | sonnet | `xhigh` |
| `func-validator` | sonnet | `high` |
| `tech-researcher` | opus | `xhigh` |

Pass abstract tier names (`"opus"`, `"sonnet"`); omit `effort` if `{EFFORT_SUPPORTED}=false`.

## Spawning a step teammate

**If agent teams are available:** spawn with `Agent` tool using `team_name: "{TEAM_NAME}"` and `run_in_background: true`. Teammates appear in the team display, can message each other, and receive shutdown requests via `SendMessage`.

**If agent teams are not available:** fall back to normal sub-agents — same spawn format but without `team_name` and `run_in_background: true`. Sub-agents can only report back to the leader.

For every step, the spawn prompt has this skeleton. **Fill in the four bracketed fields in `{AGENT_HEADER}` concretely** — never leave them as placeholders. The bmad-auto context block (in SKILL.md) is what tells the sub-agent it's part of an orchestrated workflow, not a standalone agent.

Per-role context-block values:

| Sub-agent | Specific role | What leader does with output |
|---|---|---|
| `story-creator` | Story manager creating one specific story (id + epic). Fresh-spawn per story. | Reads the story file, validates it (leader job), then sends to developer. |
| `story-developer` | Developer implementing one specific story. Fresh-spawn per story. | Reviews the diff (leader job), then sends to func-validator. Fix requests come back as Delegation Packets. |
| `func-validator` | Functional tester for one story (light or full per epic-aware policy). Fresh-spawn per story. | Reads PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL and decides commit / commit-with-caveat / fix-cycle. |
| `quick-developer` | Developer implementing one quick-flow change. One-shot. | Reviews + sends to func-validator. Fix requests come back as packets. |
| `tech-researcher` | Researcher unblocking a stuck worker via peer collaboration. | See `references/escalation.md`. |

Spawn skeleton (agent team mode — add `team_name: "{TEAM_NAME}"` and `run_in_background: true` to the Agent call; fall back to normal sub-agent without those fields if agent teams are unavailable):

```
{AGENT_HEADER — including project root, story/spec file path, Flow, Mode (team-respawn),
specific role, and what-leader-does-with-output filled in per the table above; the
"First action — invoke your BMAD role-skill" line names the role-skill from the table above}

## Task
<Single sentence: what this sub-agent does in this step.>

## Workflow skill to invoke (after role-skill is invoked)
<Exact workflow skill name from the table above (the `bmad-*` family) and args.>

## Project Context
Working directory: <absolute project root — operate here, do NOT cd into subfolders>
Knowledge sources: {KNOWLEDGE_PATHS}
Architecture & PRD: _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/
Story file (if applicable): _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/<story>.md
  → Read this first; the leader will tell you which sections are most relevant
    (e.g. "Dev Notes describes what was just implemented; check that against AC").
Read these before acting.

## Manual task handling (developer & quick-developer only)
Investigate automation first (CLI, scripts, APIs, Docker, mocks). If automatable → do it.
If truly impossible → report to team-lead with: what the task is, automation approaches
considered and why each fails, what user action is needed. Then wait.

## Reporting (document-first)
Write your detailed work into the story / tech-spec file (Dev Notes for developer,
QA Results for tester, Review Notes for review fixes). Then SendMessage to "team-lead"
with the short summary:
  "<Step result>. File: <path>. Status: <one word>. Headline: <one line>."
Leader reads the file for the full picture.
```

The `{AGENT_HEADER}` and Delegation Packet shape come from SKILL.md. Don't redefine them here.

## Per-step lifecycle

1. Spawn sub-agent with the prompt above (first message = the Delegation Packet).
2. Wait for `SendMessage` report to "team-lead".
3. Leader reviews:
   - **Success** → send `shutdown_request` → proceed to next step.
   - **Issue** → send a Round 1/2 Delegation Packet with `Prior findings verbatim` + `Specific actions`. Up to 2 leader rounds.
   - **Stuck after 2 rounds** → escalation ladder (`references/escalation.md`).
4. Shut down agent before moving on. Don't leave idle agents running — they hold context budget you'll want for the next step.

## Reviewer-fixes-issues handoff (after leader code review finds issues)

The leader does code review in this conversation. If issues are found:

1. Re-spawn the **`story-developer`** (it was shut down after Step 3) with a fresh prompt:
   - First message is the fix-request Delegation Packet.
   - Include *Prior findings verbatim* (your review report, full text).
   - Include *Specific actions* with file paths and line numbers.
   - Mark "Round 1/2".
2. Developer fixes → reports back → you re-review in this conversation → shut down developer.
3. After 2 rounds still failing → escalation ladder.

We do not spawn a separate `code-reviewer` sub-agent. The leader reviews; the developer fixes.

## Functional validation in this mode

`func-validator` is spawned per story. The leader tells it "light" or "full" in the Delegation Packet, per the policy in `references/functional-validation.md`. At epic completion, spawn one more `func-validator` for the full epic suite if the per-story runs were light.

## Context-budget sanity check

Per-step respawn already makes this mode resilient to context overflow — each agent gets a clean window for every step. The default `team-persistent` threshold (70% on a 200k tier) is too aggressive here: a per-step agent that hits 70% mid-step would have to go through the Handover protocol's round-trip even though it's about to be shut down at the step boundary anyway. Wasted cost.

Use a higher threshold — **90%** — so the check only fires on genuine in-step runaway context (a single step that's actually about to hit the wall):

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/context-usage.py \
    --agent-name "<spawn-name>" \
    --context-window 200000  \
    --policy 200k \
    --threshold-pct 90
```

When to actually run this check: **before** extending a sub-agent's life past its current step (rare), or **mid-step** when the agent has been doing tool-heavy work and the next instruction would push it deeper (e.g. another large file read, another long debug round). Don't run it at every reporting boundary — that's just overhead.

If the recommendation is `respawn-with-handover` even at 90% — and the agent has finished its current step (don't interrupt mid-step) — run the same six-step protocol described in `team-persistent.md` → "Respawn-with-handover protocol". The outgoing agent writes a handover file to `/tmp/bmad-handover-<TEAM_NAME>-<role>-<timestamp>.md` and reports the path; the leader verifies existence (`ls -la`, no read), shuts down, spawns fresh, and the new agent reads the tmp file as its first onboarding action. Leader never reads the content — that's the design.

Note: the script returns `respawn-with-handover` regardless of threshold if any prior auto-compaction happened during the agent's session — that's an unconditional reasoning-degradation signal, not a budget question.

## Idle / cross-talk

In this mode, only one sub-agent is alive at a time (with rare exceptions during escalation). Cross-talk is minimal. Idle handling: 2 cycles silent → status check; 2 status checks unanswered → shut down + respawn.

## Shutdown discipline

- After every step: `shutdown_request` to the step's sub-agent.
- Never accumulate idle agents.
- At session end: shut down anything alive + `TeamDelete` (if agent teams were created; otherwise just shut down sub-agents).
